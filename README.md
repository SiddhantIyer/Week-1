# Week-1
My project is part of the Sustainable Supply Chain Performance Dashboard in Power BI under Shell-Edunet Skills4Future. It contains data on products, sales, stock levels, lead times, manufacturing costs, inspection results, and transportation metrics. The data helps optimize supply chain efficiency and sustainability.
